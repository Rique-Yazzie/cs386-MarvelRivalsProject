# Final value proposition and consumer segments

In conclusion the information gathered led us to believe that there is a desire for centralized and clear information
about esports with a specific emphasis on up to date information that is easy to access. One thing that was noted across
the interviews was the ability to engage with anyone who posts information as well as a timestamp. Video formats were preferred
however text was also accepted as long as it was easy to read and to the point. Something to consider would be a search engine
for our website or some easy way for users to access the exact critea they are looking for. The interviews showed a variety of games
that people were interested in, meaning the type of data varies. Things like tier lists, beginer guides, and tutorials seemed
to be the most interesting topics. These discussions will help us further focus our efforts into the data people most likely
would like to see.
