**Technology**

Django

Django is our high-level Python web framework that serves as the backbone of CounterPick.gg. We leverage Django for robust backend development, managing dynamic content, data integrity, and security across the platform. A key feature is its built-in user authentication system, which simplifies the implementation of secure account creation, login, and profile management. This makes Django an ideal choice for both handling our core logic and ensuring that user data is safeguarded.

HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures the content on CounterPick.gg. It ensures that all critical game information—such as hero details, patch notes, and team compositions—is clearly presented and easily navigable. HTML’s universal compatibility and simplicity are essential for building a responsive, accessible layout that meets our user interface goals.

JavaScript

JavaScript enhances interactivity on the platform, enabling dynamic updates and real-time user feedback. It powers features like the Comp Meta tool and interactive search functionalities, ensuring that players experience a seamless, engaging interface as they explore hero statistics, update team compositions, or access community insights.

**Deployment**

- We are using a local server provided by Mark as a backend for our project. This local server is going to be an ubuntu server, managed remotely. This server will be configured to use python3, Django, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, and NGINX. As a backup solution the team is looking at AWS and Digital Ocean to provide a quick and easy solution to provide a backend that will be a quick backup just in case the local server fails.

**Lessons Learned**

In retrospective, our team learned about using langauges like Javascript, HTML, and Django. A problem we encountered was our skills using Github.
we had to refresh our core memories and skills on how to use tools like the Git bash, additonally we are still understanding how to get our backend development to work using Jango. 
We improved our skills with merging, cloning, approving pull requests, and posting issues. Our first release is
a simple skeleton of the system and we are happy with the progress we have made, we are far from finished- but we do think we have a correct schedule
and we all are looking forward to the next release which will add further implementation and expanded UX Design.
