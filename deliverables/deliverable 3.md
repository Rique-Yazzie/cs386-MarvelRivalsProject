# Deliverable 3:

**System Description**

The problem of overcomplication in learning how to play **Marvel Rivals** affects new players who are interested in getting into the game, leading to wasted time spent on understanding the *game mechanics*, frustration, and potential abandonment before they experience its full potential. For new **Marvel Rivals** players who don't have enough time to learn the in-depth *mechanics*, **CounterPick.gg** is a website designed to simplify and organize essential *gameplay information*. Unlike **MarvelRivals.com**, which primarily focuses on selling the game, **CounterPick.gg** is a dedicated teaching platform that presents key *strategies* and *mechanics* in a clear, concise, and user-friendly manner. This allows **Players** to grasp the fundamentals quickly and enjoy the game without feeling overwhelmed. The value **CounterPick.gg** provides is a faster, less frustrating learning experience, enabling **Players** to jump into the game and engage effectively.

The system must support several **Functional Requirements** to ensure an optimal user experience. The **User Interface** must be intuitive, allowing new **Players** to easily navigate the platform. A **Hero Index** will serve as a database of all **Heroes**, providing key *abilities*, *counters*, and *team synergies*. A **Tier List** will rank **Heroes** based on *competitive viability*. **Comp Meta** will display viable **Team Compositions** based on *current game balance*. The **Account System** allows **Users** to create and manage their **Profiles**, enabling features such as saving *favorite heroes* or *compositions*. **Patch Notes** and **Community Notes** will keep **Players** informed about *game updates* and allow **Users** to contribute *user-generated content*. The **Search Bar** will provide a quick way to locate specific **Heroes**, *strategies*, or **Compositions**.

**Non-functional Requirements** The platform's **Performance Efficiency** ensures it can handle increasing ***Workload*** as more **Users** access the system, maintaining responsiveness under high demand by optimizing resource usage and processing speed. To enhance **Usability**, ***Readability*** is prioritized so that *game data* is presented in a clear and digestible format, making it easier for **Users** to interpret and navigate. Additionally, **Compatibility** is essential, ensuring ***Compatibility*** across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices so that **Users** have a consistent experience regardless of their hardware or operating system. Both **Functional Suitability** and **Usability** contribute to ***Responsiveness***, allowing the platform to adapt efficiently to different screen sizes and interaction modes, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience. **Security** is a key concern, with ***Security*** measures in place to protect **User Data** from unauthorized access, breaches, and corruption through encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms. Lastly, **Supportability** is addressed through ***User Support***, which will assist **Players** with any *issues* or *questions* by providing documentation, live assistance, or automated help systems, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience.

**The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for **CounterPick.gg** consists of a **Landing Page**, **Working Links**, and **Accurate Data**. The **Landing Page** will serve as an entry point, guiding **Users** to the correct sections. Testing will verify that all elements load correctly, the layout is responsive on different devices, and navigation is intuitive. **Working Links** ensure smooth navigation throughout the platform. Testing will include automated and manual link validation to confirm that all internal and external links direct **Users** to the intended destinations without errors. **Accurate Data** guarantees that **Players** receive the most up-to-date game information. Testing will involve data integrity checks, comparing displayed information with verified game sources, and implementing automated alerts for discrepancies.  


The system supports multiple **Use Cases**. A **User** can ***Update Team Composition*** in the **Team Comp Tool**, selecting or removing **Heroes** to see updated *stats*. They can also ***View Hero Stats*** by navigating through the **Hero Index**. A **Developer** can ***Update the Hero Index*** when a new **Hero** is added, ensuring that *accurate data* is available. Additionally, a **New User** can ***Create an Account***, providing *credentials* and *email verification* to access personalized features.

The system's **User Stories** reflect the diverse needs of **Players**. A **New Player** wants to ***Find Patch Notes*** to stay updated on *game changes*. A **Veteran Player** seeks to ***Contribute to Community Notes*** to help others. A **Coach** needs an efficient tool to ***Theory-Craft Team Compositions***. A **Competitive Player** requires ***Up-to-date Information*** to track ***Meta Changes***.

For issue tracking, the project maintains an **Issue Tracker** at [GitHub](https://github.com/Rique-Yazzie/cs386-a1/issues), ensuring that *bugs*, *feature requests*, and *system improvements* are documented and addressed systematically.
