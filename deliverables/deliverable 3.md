**System Description**

The problem of overcomplication in learning how to play **Marvel Rivals** affects new players who are interested in getting into the game, leading to wasted time spent on understanding the *game mechanics*, frustration, and potential abandonment before they experience its full potential. For new **Marvel Rivals** players who don't have enough time to learn the in-depth *mechanics*, **CounterPick.gg** is a website designed to simplify and organize essential *gameplay information*. Unlike **MarvelRivals.com**, which primarily focuses on selling the game, **CounterPick.gg** is a dedicated teaching platform that presents key *strategies* and *mechanics* in a clear, concise, and user-friendly manner. This allows **Players** to grasp the fundamentals quickly and enjoy the game without feeling overwhelmed. The value **CounterPick.gg** provides is a faster, less frustrating learning experience, enabling **Players** to jump into the game and engage effectively.

The system must support several **Functional Requirements** to ensure an optimal user experience. The **User Interface** must be intuitive, allowing new **Players** to easily navigate the platform. A **Hero Index** will serve as a database of all **Heroes**, providing key *abilities*, *counters*, and *team synergies*. A **Tier List** will rank **Heroes** based on *competitive viability*. **Comp Meta** will display viable **Team Compositions** based on *current game balance*. The **Account System** allows **Users** to create and manage their **Profiles**, enabling features such as saving *favorite heroes* or *compositions*. **Patch Notes** and **Community Notes** will keep **Players** informed about *game updates* and allow **Users** to contribute *user-generated content*. The **Search Bar** will provide a quick way to locate specific **Heroes**, *strategies*, or **Compositions**.

**Non-functional Requirements** ensure that the platform is robust and scalable. The system must handle increasing ***Workload*** as more **Users** access the platform. ***Readability*** is crucial, ensuring that *game data* is presented in a digestible format. ***Compatibility*** across devices and ***Responsiveness*** are essential to make the platform accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. ***Security*** is a priority to protect **User Data**, and ***User Support*** will be available to assist **Players** with any *issues* or *questions*.

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for **CounterPick.gg** consists of a **Landing Page**, ***Working Links***, and ***Accurate Data***. The **Landing Page** will serve as an entry point, guiding **Users** to the correct sections. ***Working Links*** ensure smooth navigation, while ***Accurate Data*** guarantees that **Players** receive the most up-to-date *game information*.

The system supports multiple **Use Cases**. A **User** can ***Update Team Composition*** in the **Team Comp Tool**, selecting or removing **Heroes** to see updated *stats*. They can also ***View Hero Stats*** by navigating through the **Hero Index**. A **Developer** can ***Update the Hero Index*** when a new **Hero** is added, ensuring that *accurate data* is available. Additionally, a **New User** can ***Create an Account***, providing *credentials* and *email verification* to access personalized features.

The system's **User Stories** reflect the diverse needs of **Players**. A **New Player** wants to ***Find Patch Notes*** to stay updated on *game changes*. A **Veteran Player** seeks to ***Contribute to Community Notes*** to help others. A **Coach** needs an efficient tool to ***Theory-Craft Team Compositions***. A **Competitive Player** requires ***Up-to-date Information*** to track ***Meta Changes***.

For issue tracking, the project maintains an **Issue Tracker** at [GitHub](https://github.com/Rique-Yazzie/cs386-a1/issues), ensuring that *bugs*, *feature requests*, and *system improvements* are documented and addressed systematically.
