                <p>We're excited to kick off Season 1.5 right away with some refinement to our Super Heroes and Villains. As a reminder, players can look forward to comprehensive adjustments to Team-Up abilities beyond numerical tweaks starting in Season 2. Without further ado, let's get straight into the Balance Adjustments!</p>

The damage of each hit from Yat Jee Chung Kuen will take a hit, dropping from 19 to 10 flat damage (including during Living Chi).
