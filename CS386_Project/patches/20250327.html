                        <li>Terrifying Pounce: Resolved an issue where the Hulk could sometimes have abnormal behavior after being catapulted into a terrain KO by Wolverine's Feral Leap. Now, the big guy gets the proper beatdown without any off-script environmental stunts!</li>
                        <li>Ultimate with Pinpoint Precision: Fixed a snag in Wolverine's Ultimate Ability where, under high network latency, foes sent flying and slammed into the ground could sometimes end up in the wrong location. Now, every Last Stand lands exactly where it should.</li>

Now, Iron Man's high-tech strategy is as sleek as ever, letting him jet in and out as he pleases.</li>
