                    <h4>Hero Bug Fixes</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hawkeye's Precision: Fixed an issue where Hawkeye's passive ability Focus progress would sometimes display incorrectly. It's now as accurate as he is.</li>
                        <li>Wolverine's Unyielding Berserk Claw Strike: Frame rate no longer affects the number of attacks in the enhanced Savage Claw after using Feral Leap.</li>
                        <li>Invisible Woman's Psionic Stranglehold: Mobility abilities for specific heroes are now fully operational within the range of Invisible Woman's Psionic Vortex - no more containment issues!</li>
                        <li>Mister Fantastic Double Trouble: Addressed a bug where having two Mister Fantastic (like Loki in transformation) sometimes allowed one to reuse the second part of Distended Grip.</li>
                        <li>Namor and Invisible Woman: Fixed an issue preventing Namor and Invisible Woman from unleashing their ultimate abilities at certain door locations—now they can break through any barrier!</li>
                        <li>Storm's Doppelganger: Resolved a problem where under low frame rate conditions, activating Storm's ultimate ability as Loki after transforming into her would be canceled.</li>
                        <li>Wolverine's Fury Corrected: Fixed an issue where Wolverine's ultimate ability occasionally wouldn't end properly after landing after being pulled back.</li>
                        <li>Heroic Hint Harmony: Corrected abnormal ping prompts for some heroes.</li>

                        <li>Loki's Transformation Tweaked: Resolved a problem where Loki, after using his ultimate ability to shapeshift into the Punisher, if Warrior's Gaze was triggered when the transform was about to end its effects lingered too long. The Warrior's Gaze effect will now fade as soon as the ultimate concludes—no more lingering vision trickery!</li>
                        <li>Web-Slinging Adjustments: Fixed an issue where, in certain situations in Convoy Mode, if Peni Parker fired a Cyber-Web below the vehicle, her web would move with the vehicle. Now, her webbing sticks like it should.</li>
                        <li>Mister Fantastic's Resilience Restored: Resolved a bug where if Mister Fantastic was knocked offline while in his inflated state and then rejoined, Mister Fantastic might be unable to use some abilities after reconnecting. He's now back in action and ready to stretch into battle!</li>
                        <li>Webbing Dynamics Corrected: Corrected an issue where Peni Parker's web being pulled back could be blocked by enemy heroes, leading to positional anomalies. Now, her webbing will behave as intended.</li>
                        <li>Camera Alignment Fixed: Fixed a camera misalignment issue that could occur while KO'd and revived by Adam Warlock while spectating Hela just as she rises up to launch her Ultimate Ability.</li>
