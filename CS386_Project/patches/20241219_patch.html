                    <ol>
                        <li>Double-Elimination Tournament Display: Fixed an issue where the round display was as twisted as Loki's schemes. Now, it's crystal clear!</li>
                        <li>Tournament Exit Glitch: No more leaving the faction after a tournament and hitting a white screen of doom! We've fixed that pesky issue.</li>
                        <li>Historical Faction Access: After a tournament ends, disbanding top factions won't let you peek into the historical faction interface from the Legends Born leaderboard anymore. Fixed it faster than Quicksilver!</li>
                        <li>Faction Exit Scheduling: Exiting a faction post-tournament no longer messes with your scheduling info. All sorted!</li>
                        <li>Squirrel Girl Achievement: Enemies defeated by Unbeatable Squirrel Tsunami that get KO'd two seconds after being released now count towards the achievement!</li>
                        <li>Network Stability: Under poor network conditions, the map loading issue has been partially resolved! We're on the case, ensuring you don't get kicked offline due to connectivity issues. (There are many reasons that could cause this situation, and we have currently fixed part of the issues. We will continue to analyze and address other potential causes in the future.)</li>

                        <li>Collision Issues: Some maps had characters stuck in edge positions like they were caught in a web. We're monitoring this and will deploy fixes faster than Spider-Man can swing through the city!</li>
                        <li>Convoy Mission Performance: We've corrected an issue with abnormal vehicle performance during special convoy missions. All vehicles should now run as smoothly as a Quinjet!</li>

                        <li>Star-Lord's Low Gravity Glitch: Star-Lord's unexpected shaking when using Shift while holding Space in low gravity zones has been fixed. Now he'll rise with style!</li>
                        <li>Jeff the Land Shark's Ultimate: No more premature ends to Jeff's ultimate after swallowing a target. He's now living the ultimate life longer!</li>
                        <li>Terrain Deaths with Jeff: Fixed an issue where Jeff's ultimate would cause terrain KOs and occasionally lead to invisibility. He's back in a visible form!</li>
