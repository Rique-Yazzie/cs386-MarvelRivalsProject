                <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
                
                <h3>All Platforms</h3>
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h4>General</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-end computers running the Bazzite (Linux) system were mistakenly tapping into low-quality UI resources. Fear not—this issue has been rm'd!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h4>Maps and Gameplay</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resolved an issue where if you scored KOs during overtime and the battle concluded at that moment, the KDA tab might not have shown its true colors. Now every victory is honored!</li>
                        <li>Corrected an issue where the Yggdrasill Path cart icon in the Convoy tutorial was a bit off-target. Your heroic journey can now continue with clarity!</li>
                        <li>A heroic sweep has been performed to fix various map collisions that could trap players or allow them to slip through walls unexpectedly. Your path to glory is now cleared!</li>

                    <h4>Hero Bug Fixes</h4>

                        <li>Doctor Strange's Portal Power: Fixed an issue where Doctor Strange's portal could be interrupted during the placement phase if an allied Loki transformed into him. The Sorcerer Supreme's magic now flows uninterrupted!</li>
                        <li>Jeff the Land Shark's Bubble Trouble: Resolved a quirky situation where Jeff's bubbles could, in rare instances, sneak past enemy healing gates into the spawn room. No more bubble bath break-ins!</li>
                        <li>Iron Man's "Armless" Attack: Addressed a tech malfunction where Iron Man's arm models could go missing after activating Armor Overdrive in certain rare scenarios. The suit's back in action—fully equipped to blast into battle!</li>
                        <li>Hulk & Wolverine's Team-Up Trouble: Fixed a little mischief where because of their Team-Up Ability, Wolverine's Berserk Claw Strike could, under certain situations, be activated during Feral Leap. Now, there will be no more mix-ups!</li>
                        <li>Hulk's Charge Hiccup: Resolved a Team-Up Ability bug where if Hulk was hit by Namor's ultimate when charging to throw Wolverine, he wouldn't be thrown afterward. Now, the power duo can deliver a one-two punch without any interruptions—Hulk smash, Wolverine slash!</li>
                    </ul>
