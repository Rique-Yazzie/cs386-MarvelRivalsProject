                <p>Hi Rivals,</p>
                <p>Following the balance adjustments in Season 1.5 and the addition of the Human Torch and The Thing, we've noticed a surge in the popularity of various heroes, leading to exciting new strategies in matches. Whether it's a rush comp centered around mobile Vanguards and Duelists, a double-flyer setup featuring Storm and Human Torch, or the classic 3-1-2 lineup with three Vanguards, or even the previously popular 2-2-2 or single Vanguard compositions, each has showcased their unique flair in the current competitive environment.</p>
                <p>So, in this mid-season balance update for Season 1.5, we'll be optimizing the experience for just a handful of heroes to maintain this rich diversity. As we gear up for Season 2, expect new Heroes and fresh Team-Up Abilities to bring an even more thrilling experience!</p>
