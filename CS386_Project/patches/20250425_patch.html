                <h2>Fixes</h2>
                <h3>All Platforms</h3>
                
                <h4>General</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fixed a rare issue where players would sometimes find themselves stuck on the round-switch transition screen.</li>
                    <li>Resolved a glitch on the Krakoa map where the emote wheel occasionally couldn't be used, except for the bottom-right segment.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a Faction system bug where after a single name change, the name could not be changed again even after the cooldown period.</li>
                    <li>Resolved an issue in the Faction Recruit interface where non-leaders saw a "Only Leader Can Select" label on the Confirm button.</li>
                    <li>In Custom Game - Tournament Room settings, coaches now have an option to hide opponent voting displays in Competitive matches.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the first time entering a new season's Battle Pass screen or the moment when season-end settlement pops up and rapidly switching to the next page would sometimes cause the navigation bar to vanish.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Maps and Modes</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fixed several terrain issues that could cause characters to sometimes become stuck or clip into strange areas.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Heroes</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Emma Frost's Diamond Dynamite:</strong> Fixed a glitch in Diamond Form where her Carbon Crush would sometimes catapult foes underground—or even off the map! Now, when Emma dazzles, every move lands as sharp as a perfectly cut gem!</li>
                    <li><strong>Mister Fantastic's Fantastic Flex Fix:</strong> Resolved an issue when Flexible Elongation aimed at enemies through portals would occasionally twisted his movement trajectory into the wrong direction. Now, when Mr. Fantastic bends the rules of physics, his is as precise as his genius!</li>
                    <li><strong>Iron Fist's Chaotic Kick:</strong> Squashed a bug causing Iron Fist's K'un-Lun Kick to suddenly rollback in high-latency battles. Now, his moves blast forward with the unstoppable momentum of a true warrior!</li>
                    <li><strong>Psylocke's Wing Shurikens Tweak:</strong> Fixed a glitch where Psylocke's Wing Shurikens would sometimes lose damage after striking Loki's arm. Now, with the trickster god kept in check, her psionic shurikens strike with all the precision and brilliance of a ninja!</li>
                    <li><strong>Star-Lord's Sleepy Swagger:</strong> Resolved an issue where Star-Lord's Spartax Slumber emote was missing his signature facial animations when used during a match. Now, when he starts to nod off his playful attitude will shine through, proving that even in chaos, he's the coolest guy in the galaxy!</li>
                    <li><strong>Squirrel Girl's Animated Antics Revival:</strong> Corrected an issued with Squirrel Girl's default emote where facial expressions where missing when used in a match. Now, when she unleashes her quirky charisma, every nutty moment is captured with the full force of her animated personality!</li>
                    <li><strong>Invisible Woman's Shield Surge Update:</strong> Fixed an error in the recovery rate of Invisible Woman's Guardian Shield.</li>
