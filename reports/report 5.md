# 2. Retrospective

Appreciations: Chris did a status update to keep us on schedule.

Successes: Chris found a back-end service Django to help with our website.

Failures: Mark was sick this week so our homepage developement was slowed down for this week.

Barries: Tools, Databases, APIs - they cost money

What we should try next time: Meeting up at least more than once a week. More communication while working our tasks. We NEED to start working on Deliverable 3.
